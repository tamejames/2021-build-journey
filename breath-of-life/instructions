Instructions for recreating The Breath of Life creature

---

Setting up the Circuit Playground Express (CPE):
- Connect the CPE to your laptop via the USB-A to Micro-B cable
- Follow the instructions in 'Tutorial-for-Circuit-Playground-Express.pdf' in this folder: https://github.com/tamejames/2021-build-journey/tree/main/breath-of-life/tutorial-docs
- Things to note while following the above tutorial:
    - If you have any issues with controlling the read/write mode of the CPE, try troubleshooting with 'Supporting-notes-for-CPE.pdf' in the same folder.
    - If you are having issues with the tutorial, try this alternative tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart

Setting up the DHT11 humidity sensor:
- Follow the instructions in this tutorial to connect the DHT11 sensor to the breadboard: https://learn.adafruit.com/dht/connecting-to-a-dhtxx-sensor
- Things to note while following the above tutorial:
    - Data sheet for the DHT11 humidity sensor can be found in this folder: https://github.com/tamejames/2021-build-journey/tree/main/breath-of-life/tutorial-docs. The File is called 'DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf'
    - When connecting the DHT11 to the Circuit Playground Express (CPE), you should make the following connections:
      - VCC of humidity sensor <--> the VOUT connection on the CPE
      - Ground of humidity sensor <--> any GND connections on the CPE
      - Data out of humidity sensor <--> any of the input/output pads on the CPE (The Breath of Life used the A2 pinout connection)
    - You can see an image showing the circuit layout if you zoom into the left-hand side of this image: https://buildjourney.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/creature-hw-sw-separate.png?w=300

Setting up code for The Breath of Life:
- Once the hardware is connected, you should be able to directly run the code file 'breath-of-life-code.py'
- Note that in order to run this program in the Mu code editor, you will need to rename the file to 'code.py'
- If you want to edit the code, make sure the Circuit Playground Express is in 'write' mode
- If you want to run the code, make sure the Circuit Playground Express is in 'read' mode
- In order to make the program run or stop running, you can simply press the button in the middle of the Circuit Playground Express

Setting up the aesthetic design for The Breath of Life:
- Take a toilet roll and wrap it in brown felt fabric, and secure it in place with tape or by stapling the fabric folds to the toilet roll - this will be the 'tree trunk'
- Take another sheet of felt (yellow or green probably work best to resemble sand or grass) and stick it down on a flat surface to act as the 'ground' for the creature
- Secure the 'tree trunk' to the 'ground' using blu tack
- Cut two small pieces of felt (for The Breath of Life a pink fabric was used) and use it to create a nose and mouth as shown in the right-most image here (note that the nose is placed on the middle button of the CPE): https://buildjourney.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/creature-aesthetic-progress.png?w=1024
- Attach two googly eyes to the CPE using blu tack
- Sit the Circuit Playground Express on the top of the tree trunk and secure it using blu tack
- Attach branches by sticking them down the tube of the toilet roll, and securing with blu tack where needed until you are satisfied with the appearance of your creature
